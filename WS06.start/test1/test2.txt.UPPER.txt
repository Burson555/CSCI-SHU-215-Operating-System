JUST AS HE HAD SENSED, THE WISE CATALONIAN DID NOT WRITE AGAIN. THE STRANGER’S LETTER, WHICH NO ONE READ, WAS LEFT TO THE MERCY OF THE MOTHS ON THE SHELF WHERE FERNANDA HAD FORGOTTEN HER WEDDING RING ON OCCASION AND THERE IT REMAINED, CONSUMING ITSELF IN THE INNER FIRE OF ITS BAD NEWS AS THE SOLITARY LOVERS SAILED AGAINST THE TIDE OF THOSE DAYS OF THE LAST STAGES, THOSE IMPENITENT AND ILL-FATED TIMES WHICH WERE SQUANDERED ON THE USELESS EFFORT OF MAKING THEM DRIFT TOWARD THE DESERT OF DISENCHANTMENT AND OBLIVION. AWARE OF THAT MENACE, AURELIANO AND AMARANTA ÚRSULA SPENT THE HOT MONTHS HOLDING HANDS, ENDING WITH THE LOVE OF LOYALTY FOR THE CHILD WHO HAD HIS BEGINNING IN THE MADNESS OF FORNICATION. AT NIGHT, HOLDING EACH OTHER IN BED, THEY WERE NOT FRIGHTENED BY THE SUBLUNARY EXPLOSIONS OF THE ANTS OR THE NOISE OF THE MOTHS OR THE CONSTANT AND CLEAN WHISTLE OF THE GROWTH OF THE WEEDS IN THE NEIGHBORING ROOMS. MANY TIMES THEY WERE AWAKENED BY THE TRAFFIC OF THE DEAD. THEY COULD HEAR ÚRSULA FIGHTING AGAINST THE LAWS OF CREATION TO MAINTAIN THE LINE, AND JOSÉ ARCADIO BUENDÍA SEARCHING FOR THE MYTHICAL TRUTH OF THE GREAT INVENTIONS, AND FERNANDA PRAYING, AND COLONEL AURELIANO BUENDÍA STUPEFYING HIMSELF WITH THE DECEPTION OF WAR AND THE LITTLE GOLD FISHES, AND AURELIANO SEGUNDO DYING OF SOLITUDE IN THE TURMOIL OF HIS DEBAUCHES, AND THEN THEY LEARNED THAT DOMINANT OBSESSIONS CAN PREVAIL AGAINST DEATH AND THEY WERE HAPPY AGAIN WITH THE CERTAINTY THAT THEY WOULD GO ON LOVING EACH OTHER IN THEIR SHAPE AS APPARITIONS LONG AFTER OTHER SPECIES OF FUTURE ANIMALS WOULD STEAL FROM THE INSECTS THE PARADISE OF MISERY THAT THE INSECTS WERE FINALLY STEALING FROM MAN.
